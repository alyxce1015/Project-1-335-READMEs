# Algorithm 1 
This is the steps to execute Algorithm 1 Wildlife monitoring system

# Execution 

* Initialize new varible with any name which will be used as test case
* set the value of this as any tuple in the form (n, []) where n = number of nodes and [] = list of coordiante pairs
* call functionName(*variable_name) to run function
