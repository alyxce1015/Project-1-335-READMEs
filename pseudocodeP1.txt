IsCycle(n, coords):
    Create an adjacency list 'graph' to store the paths between nodes.
    insert nodes into 'graph' using the given coordinate pairs.
    
    Initialize a 'visited' set to track nodes that are visited.
    
    Define a recursive function DFS(node, parent):
        Mark 'node' as visited.
        For each neighbor in graph[node]:
            If 'neighbor' is not visited:
               Recursively call DFS(neighbor, node)
            Else if 'neighbor' is visited AND 'neighbor' is not the parent of 'node':
               Return True
        Return False
    
    Iterate through all nodes in the graph:
        If node is not visited:
            If DFS(node, -1) returns True, print "Loop detected"
            return
    
    Print "No loop detected" if no cycle is found.
